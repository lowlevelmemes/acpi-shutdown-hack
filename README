ACPI shutdown hack
==================

This is a *hack* to support shutdown in OSes where full support for ACPI is
lacking.

To use the hack, integrate the acpi_shutdown_hack.{c,h} files in your codebase.

The interface to shutdown is extremely simple and self documenting.
See acpi_shutdown_hack.h.
